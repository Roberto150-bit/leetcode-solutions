## LeetCode Solutions in Java, Python, C, and C++ 🚀

This repository contains my clean, well-commented solutions to LeetCode problems across four languages:

- ✅ Java (technical interviews, OOP)
- 🐍 Python (fast scripting and ML)
- ⚙️ C (systems and compiler fundamentals)
- ⚡ C++ (STL, performance, competitive programming)

I solve each problem in multiple languages to build deep algorithmic understanding and language fluency.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I'm preparing for interviews, research, and real-world systems by solving LeetCode problems *the right way* — not just for speed, but for:

- Mastery of data structures and algorithms
- Fluency in multiple programming languages
- Clean, professional-level code with structure and clarity
- A resource I can look back on, and that others can learn from

## 🧩 Folder Structure

All problems are organized by:

1. **Language**  
2. **Topic** (e.g. arrays, hashmap, DP)
3. **Difficulty** (easy / medium / hard)

Each file includes:
- 🔗 Link to the LeetCode problem
- 🧠 Thought process / approach
- 🧪 Time and space complexity
- ✅ Clean code with comments
